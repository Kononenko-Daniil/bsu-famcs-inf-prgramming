i have english on monday, wednesday and thursday. english is usually the second lesson.

at the english lesson they speak, read and write. they speak about school, pupils and teachers, about lessons, animals and nature, about our friends, sports and games. they read books and stories about children, nature, school life and so on. they write letters, words, sentences, exercises and dictations.

we play at english, too. they sing songs and learn poems.

i like english. i can read and write well, but i can't speak english well yet.
